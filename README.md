Welcome to Trivia Trials!

Trivia Trials is a random trivia game created by myself (Evan Lowell) for the NC State Software Development Bootcamp. It is meant to display skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Instructions, citations, and a link to the game can be found below. Additionally, thank you to the instructors and all others who make the program possible.
